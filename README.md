## ForexPricePredictor
Idea of that program is basing on sentdex tutorial - how to predict future trend comparing last 30 values to other periods.
Its cuting sample data downloaded from yahoo finance for periods lenght of 30 values. Then looking for similiarity between last period and other samples. 
If the similiarity is over given point its appending plot with this sample. 
Basing on similiar samples and their future direction is trying to predict current future direction.

## TODO:
  It could use pandas or numpy for better array management and better compute time.
